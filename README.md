various animal at different position, to send us backward or forward, we need to reach the end. print the steps. 
we can move ahead by random steps and if we step on any tiles with animal then we move backward by some steps or if move to a tile with Trampolines then we move forward by some steps. 
Used java to write code. used serializable to read and write the file for future reference /to save the game. also handled all the possible exceptions. 
in the end printed the number of snake,vulture and other animals bites and number of Trampolines reached on the way.
